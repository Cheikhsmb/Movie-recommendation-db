✨ **Project Overview**

Our Movie Recommendation Database is a relational schema built to power a streaming platform’s personalized movie suggestions. It captures:

* 👥 **Users** (profiles & signup dates)
* 🎬 **Movies** (titles, release years, directors)
* 🏷️ **Genres** (action, drama, comedy…)
* ⭐ **Ratings** (1–5 stars with timestamps)
* 📺 **WatchHistory** (who watched what & when)

With this foundation, you can run collaborative-filtering queries like “users who liked 🎥 A also liked 🎥 B” to drive tailored recommendations.

🎯 **Objectives**

* 🗺️ Define a clear, normalized ER model covering all entities
* 🛠️ Implement the physical schema (DDL), constraints, and load realistic sample data
* 💡 Craft SQL queries demonstrating collaborative-filtering logic
* 📚 Provide step-by-step setup instructions so everyone can clone, load, and test
* 🎤 Bundle ER diagrams, scripts, data, and example queries for a smooth demo presentation
